# Instructions  


1. Create and then fetch the save-element paragraph and store it in a variable called saveElement.
2. Create a variable that contains both the count and the dash separator. For example: "12 - "
3. Render the variable in the saveElement using innerText. 
4. (Make sure you don't delete the existing content of the paragraph.)

The final result should look like this:
